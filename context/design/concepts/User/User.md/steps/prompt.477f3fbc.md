# prompt: Now give me test cases for getUserById. Keep in mind what I said previously, don't use functions like BeforeEach and AfterAll which are not supported by Deno. For both the implementations and test cases, only give me the new item that I ask for, unless adding it requires changes to previous code like imports, etc.
