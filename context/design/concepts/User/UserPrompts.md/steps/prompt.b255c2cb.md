# prompt: Slight edit on the test cases: the test cases for each individual action don't need to be as detailed, at minimum show it operating as intended then maybe 1 to 2 edge cases. After all actions are implemented for a concept, then I will rework or update the test cases to fulfill the requirements from the previous prompt. For now, just give me a simpler version of the test cases for the registerUser in User.
