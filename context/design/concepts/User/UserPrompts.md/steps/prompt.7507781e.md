# prompt: I pasted what you gave me into src/concepts/User/UserConcept.ts, but encountered these errors with the imports: Inline 'npm:', 'jsr:' or 'https:' dependency not allowed. Add it as a dependency in a deno.json or package.json instead and reference it here via its bare specifier. Could not find a matching package for 'npm:bcrypt' in the node\_modules directory. Ensure you have all your JSR and npm dependencies listed in your deno.json or package.json, then run `deno install`. Alternatively, turn on auto-install by specifying `"nodeModulesDir": "auto"` in your deno.json file.deno(resolver-error). Inline 'npm:', 'jsr:' or 'https:' dependency not allowed.
