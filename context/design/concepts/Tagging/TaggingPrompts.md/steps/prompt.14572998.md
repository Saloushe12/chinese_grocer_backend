# prompt: Modify the existing test cases to include: A sequence of action executions that corresponds to the operational principle, representing the common expected usage of the concept. These sequence is not required to use all the actions; operational principles often do not include a deletion action, for example. Also include sequences of action executions that correspond to less common cases: probing interesting corners of the functionality, undoing actions with deletions and cancellations, repeating actions with the same arguments, etc. In some of these scenarios actions may be expected to throw errors. For each concept, you should have one test sequence for the operational principle, and 3-5 additional interesting scenarios. Every action should be executed successfully in at least one of the scenarios. Your test cases should not require any setting up of the concept state except by calling concept actions. When you are testing one action at a time, this means that you will want to order your actions carefully (for example, by the operational principle) to avoid having to set up state. Test the operational principle and a couple interesting edge cases. Most or all of the cases should use most or all of the actions, simulating real usage scenarios. Ensure there are fewer than ten total test cases, even fewer than that is ok as long as important edge cases are tested.
