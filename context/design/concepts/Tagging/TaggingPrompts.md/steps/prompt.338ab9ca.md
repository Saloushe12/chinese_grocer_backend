# prompt: Error from the test case: Tagging Concept - addTag, removeTag, and \_getStoresByTag Action Tests ... Scenario 2: Edge Cases for removeTag and \_getStoresByTag (non-existent stores/tags, empty strings) => ./src/concepts/Tagging/TaggingConcept.test.ts:176:13; error: AssertionError: Values are not equal: Store '019a062a-2a6d-7816-9210-4463018617c7' should still have 1 tag. \[Diff] Actual / Expected: 2 / 1. Review the spec linked from previous prompts, and figure out what the test case is actually supposed to do, according to the spec. Only give me the updated test case, as well as reasoning behind your edits.
