# Concept: Store

**purpose**
Represent the identity and physical address of a store.

**principle**
A store's existence and location are fundamental. Interactions related to its classification, user feedback, or popularity are external concerns managed by other concepts through synchronizations.

***

## **state**

Each `Store` is represented by:

| Field         | Type    | Description                                         |
|---------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `storeId`     | String  | Unique document identifier (generated by system)     |
| `name`        | String  | Name of the store                                   |
| `address`     | String  | String representation of the store's address        |

***

## **actions**

### `createStore(name: String, address: String): { storeId: String } | { error: String }`

**requires**

* No existing store has both the exact same `name` and `address`.

**effects**
Creates a new store record and returns its unique `storeId`.

**returns**

* `{ storeId }` on success
