# prompt: I am getting this error: Property 'stores' is private and only accessible within class 'StoreConcept'. I believe this is because a function to query this value has not been created yet, because it is not the first action. To fix this, create the implementation for the rest of the Store concept. The Store concept is in the link above, look at what I have now as well as the specifications linked in previous prompts, implement the rest of the actions.
