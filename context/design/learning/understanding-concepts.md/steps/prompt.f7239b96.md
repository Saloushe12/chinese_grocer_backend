# prompt: My current objective is to add syncs to my design. Use the info in the @sync-info as context. Previously, it was just a direct server, now there will be a request server. @sync-recommendations are recommendations for what to sync vs not sync, from ChatGPT. Use it as a guide. Edit the spec using these syncs as the de facto ones, removing all old "syncs". Also, give me code for the implementations of these syncs, as well as where they would belong, and justification for each.
