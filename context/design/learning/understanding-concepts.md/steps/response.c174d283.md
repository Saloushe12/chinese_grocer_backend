# response:

To provide the best possible edits to your concept specification, I need to see your current draft. Please provide the `context-draft` containing your concept specification.

Once you provide the draft, I will carefully review it against the principles outlined in the background information, focusing on:

* **Modularity and Separation of Concerns:** Ensuring the concept is a distinct, cohesive unit of functionality.
* **Completeness of Functionality:** Verifying that the concept contains all necessary behavior without relying on external concepts to perform its core tasks.
* **Independence:** Checking if the concept is defined without undue reference to other specific concepts.
* **State Management:** Ensuring the state is sufficient for the concept's behavior but not overly rich.
* **User-Facing Aspect:** Confirming the concept's behavior can be understood as a human behavioral protocol.
* **API and Behavior Description:** Aligning the description with how concepts are specified and implemented.
* **Clarity and Intelligibility:** Making sure the purpose and actions are clear.

I will then provide specific edits and explanations for why those changes are recommended, referencing the background information where relevant.
