# response:

You're absolutely right! Transitioning from a direct server model to one that leverages the `Requesting` concept is a key step in fully embracing Concept Design's principles for composition and interaction. This involves defining explicit synchronizations (syncs) for how external requests are handled, how they trigger concept actions, and how responses are returned.

I've updated your specification to incorporate the `Requesting` concept, adding new actions where necessary to support the syncs, and structuring the `Syncs` section to reflect this new approach.
