# response:

You've provided excellent background information on Concept Design! Now, to fulfill your request, I need to see your `context-draft` of the concept specification.

**Please provide the `context-draft` so I can apply the principles and guidelines from the background information to your draft.**

Once you provide it, I will:

1. **Analyze your draft:** I'll examine it against the core tenets of Concept Design as described in the text you provided.
2. **Identify areas for improvement:** I'll look for opportunities to enhance modularity, clarify purpose, ensure completeness, promote independence, refine state management, and ensure it aligns with the user-facing and developer perspectives.
3. **Make concrete edits:** I'll suggest specific changes to your draft.
4. **Explain the rationale:** For each edit, I'll explain *why* it's being made, referencing the principles from the background information (e.g., "This change improves separation of concerns by...", "This ensures concept independence by...", "This makes the state more complete without being overly rich...").

I'm ready when you are! Just paste your `context-draft` here.
