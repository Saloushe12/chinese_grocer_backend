# Revised Concept Design Specification

## Changes Made:

1. **New Actions in Existing Concepts:**
   * `Review` concept: Added `deleteReviewsByUser(userId: String)` to support cascading user deletion.
   * `Localization` concept: Added `clearUserLanguage(userId: String)` to support cascading user deletion.
2. **Expanded Syncs Section:**
   * **Request Handling Syncs:** For every user-facing action and query across all concepts, I've created a pair of syncs:
     * One sync to capture the `Requesting.request` and trigger the corresponding concept action.
     * Another sync to capture the successful completion of the concept action and trigger `Requesting.respond` with the appropriate data (or a success status).
   * **Internal Syncs:** The previously defined internal synchronizations (`AggregateReviewRating`, `CascadeReviewDeletion`, `CascadeUserDataDeletion`, `EnsureUserExistsForReview`) have been retained. Their `when` clauses will now be triggered by the underlying concept actions, which are themselves initiated by the new request-handling syncs.
   * **Query Handling:** For concept queries, the sync captures the `Requesting.request`, performs the query, and immediately responds with the results, using `collectAs` where multiple results are expected.
   * **Error Handling (Implicit):** Following the design guidance, I have not explicitly added `(error: String)` return types to the concept actions themselves. Therefore, syncs for explicit error responses are not included. If a `requires` clause is not met, or an underlying concept action fails, the `Requesting.request` will implicitly fail (e.g., time out) as no `Requesting.respond` sync will be triggered for that flow.
