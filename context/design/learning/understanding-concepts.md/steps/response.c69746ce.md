# response:

Okay, I understand. I will now analyze your provided draft (`context-draft`) based on the principles of Concept Design you've so clearly laid out. Please provide the `context-draft` so I can proceed with the edits. I will focus on ensuring your specification adheres to the rules and advice from the background information regarding:

* **Modularity and Separation of Concerns:** Is the concept a distinct, coherent unit of functionality?
* **Completeness of Functionality:** Does the concept contain all its necessary behavior, or does it inappropriately rely on other concepts?
* **Independence:** Is the concept defined without unnecessary coupling to other specific concepts?
* **State Management:** Is the state sufficient but not excessively rich?
* **User-Facing Aspect:** Is the behavior understandable as a human protocol?
* **API and Behavior Clarity:** Are the actions and purpose clearly defined from both user and developer perspectives?
* **Reusability and Familiarity:** Does the concept design lend itself to these qualities?

Once you provide the draft, I'll give you a revised version with explanations for each significant change.
