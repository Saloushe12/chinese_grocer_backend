I added this new concept to my overall spec because my original spec was missing a way for users to register to hold accounts, which should be necessary in order to post reviews and ratings. I decided that I would have a password complexity requirement, because it is a basic level of security that all working web apps should have to guarantee a level of safety for the user, so passwords must be at least eight characters long. I decided to make userId generated by the system instead of just using what the user input as their username, so that the system can have redundant usernames and find using unique userId, plus userId adds a level of control and abstraction for the system. This is also helpful for the user because they can only delete their account if they know their userid. Context advised me to use hashing for user passwords, so that is added as a property of the UserConcept.
